Treat Wheel 0.0.6 is here.

This version enhances ReVanced modules hiding, by bringing the concept of Treat Wheel module configuration file. By creating a tw_config file at the module's directory, with the following content, it allows Treat Wheel to recognize it is a ReVanced module, hence make it umount. If a module doesn't contain this file, it will not umount, as a limitation of how ReVanced umount system works. Because of that, users are encouraged to ask ReVanced module developers to include that file.

```
module_type=revanced
allow_umount=true
```

If you have issues with this issue, expect no fixes unless you report it. Collaborate, assist, do not leave developers in the void, like how it happened in 0.0.5 release.

Do not enable, or disable, options you do not understand. Trust the default.

Special thanks to the translators who allowed to bring more idioms to Treat Wheel WebUI: @Katiria24, Gege, @ziomek64, @RainyXeon, @bocchi1919810, Ray. Not only them, but also the primary testers for these releases, @rrr333nnn333, @ph03nIx.
